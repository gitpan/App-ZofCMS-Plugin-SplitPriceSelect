App-ZofCMS-Plugin-SplitPriceSelect

The module is a plugin for L<App::ZofCMS> that allows you to give several prices and plugin
will create a C<< <select> >> HTML element with its C<< <option> >>s containing I<ranges> of
prices. The idea is that you'd specify how many options you would want to have and plugin will
figure out how to split the prices to generate that many ranges.
